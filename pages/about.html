      <p>
        This website was made as a refresher on HTML for myself, as a playground for future web frameworks, and as a place for me to post my thoughts incase someday someone cares to read them.

      <p>
        I started programming at a young age and was really brought in by the idea that I could create things virtually just by typing at a computer. I've always loved building things and programming caters to that.
