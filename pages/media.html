          I've consumed a lot of media that I've enjoyed, whether it be television, movies, music, books, etc.
          I end up forgetting what my thoughts were at the time of consumption.
          This corner of my website is dedicated to archiving my thoughts on various pieces of media at time of consumption along with (sometimes) for in depth pieces about my thoughts on specific pieces of media that I feel deserve special attention.
